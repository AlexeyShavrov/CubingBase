This is a project about SeepCubing. It presents a base of algorythms for speedSolving and a trainer for practicing fast case-identification on the last-layer stage. 
The algorythms include standart CFOP PLL cases and less popular COLL and Winter Variation bases. Tips on their application in solves are given in the corresponding chapters.
Get better, share knoledge and enjoy yourselves!
